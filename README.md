# Password-Manager
A simple (and very insecure) password manager with java swing

If you run a java file, a window will pop up prompting you to create a main password. If you forget it, you manually have to delete all the files in the "Passwords" folder.
All passwords get encrypted with the main password. This means, that the encryption of each password will vary based on your main password.
